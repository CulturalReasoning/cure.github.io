# CuRe: Cultural Reasoning for Responsible Language Model Development
*Independent Research Fund Denmark (DFF), 2026–2030*

---

## **Project Summary**

CuRe investigates how language models interpret culture — not through facts or stereotypes, but through the rich, ambiguous, and historically layered world of literature. By combining NLP, literary studies, and expert-driven evaluation design, the project develops new methods for assessing and improving cultural reasoning in AI systems.

## **Why Culture? Why Literature?**

Culture shapes meaning, and meaning is where AI struggles most.

Literature embeds cultural knowledge through:

* **Referencing** — allusions, echoes of earlier works
* **Reuse** — motifs, clichés, idioms, recurring patterns
* **Perspective and interpretation** — multiple legitimate readings

This makes literature the ideal testing ground for evaluating how AI understands culture — and for building models that respect cultural nuance rather than reducing it to stereotypes.

---

## **Objectives**

CuRe addresses three core research questions:

1. **How can we build robust benchmarks for cultural reasoning where multiple interpretations are valid?**
2. **How do we model and evaluate interpretive depth in AI, beyond surface pattern recognition?**
3. **How can we improve cultural reasoning in AI responsibly, without reinforcing essentialism?**

---

## **Work Packages**

### **WP1 — Empirical Foundations**

Construction of high-quality corpora and interpretive benchmarks based on Danish literature, including MeMo, Mini-WorldLit, and canonical texts. Data includes passages, interpretive annotations, student essays, and expert commentary, designed following the ECBD framework.

### **WP2 — Methodological Reflection**

Evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), long-context models, and soft-label annotation strategies. Analysis of interpretive ambiguity, multiple valid readings, and the relationship between close and distant reading.

### **WP3 — Model Adaptation & Training**

Adaptation of Danish Foundation Models (DFM), experiments with pretraining mixtures, fine-tuning with expert feedback, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning.
